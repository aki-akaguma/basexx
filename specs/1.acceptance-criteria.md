# Acceptance Criteria - basexx

## Ubiquitous Requirements

**U1:** The system shall provide encoding and decoding functions for all supported bases.

## Feature-Specific Requirements

### Base64 Encoding
**F1:** When the user provides data, the system shall correctly encode it into Base64 format.
**F2:** When the user provides a Base64 string, the system shall correctly decode it back to the original data.
**F3:** Where the `base64g` feature is enabled, the system shall use the `base64g` variant for encoding and decoding.

### Base58 Encoding
**F4:** When the user provides data, the system shall correctly encode it into Base58 format.
**F5:** When the user provides a Base58 string, the system shall correctly decode it back to the original data.
**F6:** Where the `base58b` feature is enabled, the system shall use the `base58b` variant for encoding and decoding.
**F7:** Where the `base58r` feature is enabled, the system shall use the `base58r` variant for encoding and decoding.

### Base56 Encoding
**F8:** When the user provides data, the system shall correctly encode it into Base56 format.
**F9:** When the user provides a Base56 string, the system shall correctly decode it back to the original data.

### Base32 Encoding
**F10:** When the user provides data, the system shall correctly encode it into Base32 format.
**F11:** When the user provides a Base32 string, the system shall correctly decode it back to the original data.
**F12:** Where the `base32i` feature is enabled, the system shall use the `base32i` variant for encoding and decoding.

### Ags Encoding
**F13:** When the user provides data, the system shall correctly encode it using the `ags` scheme.
**F14:** When the user provides an `ags` encoded string, the system shall correctly decode it back to the original data.

## Performance Requirements

**P1:** Where the CPU supports AVX2, the system shall use AVX2-optimized functions for supported bases.
**P2:** Where the CPU supports SSSE3, the system shall use SSSE3-optimized functions for supported bases.
**P3:** While running on a CPU without AVX2 or SSSE3 support, the system shall use the scalar implementation.

## Optional Feature Requirements

**O1:** Where the `rug` feature is enabled, the system shall use the `rug` library for high-performance arithmetic.
**O2:** Where the `aligned_data` feature is enabled, the system shall support aligned data structures.

## Test and Benchmark Requirements

**T1:** When the `bench` feature is enabled, the system shall build the benchmarking suite.
**T2:** When the `abench` feature is enabled, the system shall build a specific set of benchmarks.
**T3:** When the `ubench` feature is enabled, the system shall build another specific set of benchmarks.
**T4:** When the `nobench` feature is enabled, the system shall not build any benchmarks.
**T5:** The system shall provide a test binary named `basexx` for testing and demonstration.
