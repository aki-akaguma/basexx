# Project: basexx

## 1. Core Functionality

The `basexx` library provides implementations for various base encoding and decoding schemes. It is designed for performance, with optional SIMD optimizations (AVX2, SSSE3) for several of the supported bases.

## 2. Modules

The library is organized into the following modules:

- **`base64`**: Standard Base64 encoding and decoding.
- **`base58`**: Base58 encoding, commonly used in cryptocurrencies.
- **`base56`**: Base56 encoding.
- **`base32`**: Standard Base32 encoding.
- **`ags`**: A custom encoding scheme.

### 2.1. Module Variants

Several modules have variants, likely for different use cases or legacy compatibility:

- **`base32i`**: A variant of Base32.
- **`base58b`**: A variant of Base58.
- **`base58r`**: A variant of Base58.
- **`base64g`**: A variant of Base64.

## 3. Performance Optimizations

The library leverages SIMD instructions to accelerate encoding and decoding operations. The following instruction sets are supported, where applicable:

- **AVX2**
- **SSSE3**

A scalar implementation is available as a fallback for systems without SIMD support.

## 4. Dependencies

### 4.1. Main Dependencies

- **`num-bigint`**: Used for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, which is essential for base conversions.
- **`rug`**: (Optional) Provides bindings to the GMP, MPFR, and MPC libraries for high-performance multi-precision arithmetic. This is enabled with the `rug` feature.

### 4.2. Development Dependencies

- **`criterion`**: For benchmarking the performance of the library.
- **`rstest`**: For writing and running tests.
- **`rstest_reuse`**: For reusing test setups.

## 5. Features

The following feature flags are available:

- **`aligned_data`**: Enables functionality related to aligned data.
- **`rug`**: Enables the `rug` dependency for high-performance arithmetic.
- **`bench`**: Enables general benchmarking.
- **`abench`**: Enables a specific set of benchmarks.
- **`ubench`**: Enables another specific set of benchmarks.
- **`nobench`**: Disables benchmarks.

## 6. Binary

A test binary named `basexx` is included for demonstration and testing purposes. It is built from `src/test_main.rs`.
